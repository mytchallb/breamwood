Arena, not instant fight results.
Arena gives gold, not XP

Fights give XP + small bit of gold
Dungeon is the same, an image of hallways, choose left, right etc. Text descriptions, action buttons

King can give multiple quests / job board so player can choose. Quest rewards gold, tells dungeon tips
